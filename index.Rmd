Hi, my name is Grace! I'm a first year master's student at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management specializing in Conservation Planning and Coastal Marine Resource Management. 

When I'm not stuck behind a screen, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen with new cuisines, knitting hats for anyone who will wear them, and exploring outdoor spaces in and around California! I am interested in furthering my skills in data science and visualization, as well as gaining exposure to various careers in the field of conservation and marine science.
