**Figure 1:** Annual lake level measurements (feet above sea level) between 1850 and 2017 collected from the [Mono Basin Clearinghouse](https://www.monobasinresearch.org/). Lake levels that pose significance to nesting bird populations are noted with horizontal lines. At 6,377 ft above sea level, a land bridge emerges that allows predators access to crucial California Gull nesting habitat. Salinity reaches 120 g/L at 6,360 ft above sea level and 150 g/L at 6,350 feet above sea level, resulting in decreased food availability for Eared Grebes and California Gulls. Notable years are annotated on the graph (1941: LADWP began diverting water from Mono Lake's tributary streams; 1978: Mono Lake Committee formed; 1983: California Supreme Court decision; 1994: State Water Board decision). Further information about these dates and more can be found on the Mono Lake [website](https://www.monolake.org/learn/aboutmonolake/savingmonolake/#water-diversions-almost-destroyed-mono-lake).
