```{r}
# Read in the data
little_women_text <- pdf_text(here("data", "little_women.pdf")) 

# Wrangling!
little_women_tidy <- data.frame(little_women_text) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_split(little_women_text, pattern = "\\n")) %>% 
  unnest(text_full) %>%

# Remove all stop words and other unwanted names/words

  filter(word != "jo",

         word != "ing")

nonstop_counts <- little_women_nonstop_words %>% 
  count(chapter, word)
```

### 1) Top 5 words in *Little Women* part 1

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Find top 5 words for part 1
top_5_words <- nonstop_counts %>% 
  filter(chapter == 1:23) %>% # filter for first 23 chapters (part 1)
  group_by(chapter) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

# Visualize
ggplot(data = top_5_words, aes(x = word, y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "aquamarine3") +
  facet_wrap(~chapter, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 9),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 14)) +
  labs(x = "Word",
      y = "Count")
```

**Figure 1:** Column graphs faceted by chapter to display top 5 most commonly used words in Louisa May Alcott's *Little Women* part 1 (chapters 1-23). Stop words such as "the", "is", and "and" were removed in addition to character names. 

### 2) Top 35 words in *Little Women* chapter 5: "Being Neighborly"

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Select top 35 words for chapter 5
ch5_top35 <- nonstop_counts %>% 
  filter(chapter == 5) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:35)

# Create wordcloud
ch5_cloud <- ggplot(data = ch5_top35, aes(label = word)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud(aes(color = n, size = n), shape = "circle") +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("goldenrod2", "tomato2", "violetred2")) +
  theme_minimal() 

ch5_cloud
```

**Figure 2:** Wordcloud displaying the top 35 words used in *Little Women* chapter 5: "Being Neighborly". Similar to figure 1, stop words and main character names were removed to provide a more interesting assortment of words. 

### 3) Sentiment analysis of *Little Women* parts 1 & 2 using the AFINN lexicon

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Sentiment analysis using afinn lexicon
afinn_pos <- get_sentiments("afinn") %>% # check out all words that are scored as "positive" or above 2
  filter(value > 2)

little_women_afinn <- little_women_nonstop_words %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))

afinn_counts <- little_women_afinn %>% 
  count(chapter, value) 

afinn_means <- little_women_afinn %>% 
  group_by(chapter) %>% 
  summarize(mean_afinn = mean(value))

ggplot(data = afinn_means,
       aes(x = chapter, y = mean_afinn)) +
  geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Mean sentiments",
       x = "Chapter")
```

**Figure 3:** Column graph showcasing the average sentiments of *Little Women* parts 1 & 2 (chapters 1-47) using the AFINN lexicon. Mean sentiment values less than zero indicate that on average, the words used in a particular chapter had more negative connotations than those with mean sentiments greater than zero. 

```{r}
# Sentiment analysis using NRC lexicon
#little_women_nrc <- little_women_nonstop_words %>% 
  #inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

#little_women_nrc_counts <- little_women_nrc %>% 
  #count(chapter, sentiment)

#ggplot(data = little_women_nrc_counts, aes(x = sentiment, y = n)) +
  #geom_col() +
  #facet_wrap(~chapter) +
  #coord_flip()
```
